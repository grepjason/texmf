# ~/texmf

My personal, `local`, additions to the `texmf` directory tree.

## Preliminaries

Download and install a TeX distribution (e.g., [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)) on your device.

## License

Public domain. (Quite obviously this only applies to stuff I've written, i.e., things without an explicit attribution.)

Happy **TeX**ing!
